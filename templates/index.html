      These chat rooms can help you if you are feeling low and need to talk to someone who understands just what it is that you are going through.
      You can find a safe place to express yourself and get support from others who are also experiencing the same. These rooms are not a substitute for professional treatment for mental health, but you may find the community to be supportive.
