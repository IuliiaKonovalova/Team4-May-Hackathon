Created for the Code Institute's May 2022 Hackathon, Getting Connected.

# About 

Connectedsy is an online communication platform aimed towards people experiencing loneliness and other mental health issues. The platform allows users to create their very own profile where they can include some of their personal hobbies and interests. This profile is then stored in a database, allowing users to return to the site at any time and have their preferences retained. 

Once a user signs up for the site, they can jump straight into a chat room that is relevant to what they are experiencing, and connect with people who understand what they are going through. They can then speak openly about themselves, what they are experiencing, and about shared hobbies and interests. The primary goal is to ensure that users know that they are always welcome on Connectedsy and always have a space to talk and be supported.

In creating this platform, our team has put great emphasis on creating Connectedsy as a safe space where people can speak freely, express themselves and be supported by each other. However, we ensure that users are aware from the outset that the platform is not intended to be a substitute for professional help and we encourage users to seek professional help should they need it.

# Target Audience

Connectedsy is an online communication platform aimed towards people experiencing mental health issues. There are a variety of chat rooms that are separated by different mental health issues that include depression, social anxiety, PTSD and more. In creating Connectedsy, our team aims to create a space for people to connect with others who are suffering from similar issues. The platform also includes a chat room for people who may not be suffering from any severe mental health issues, but still may be experiencing loneliness and would like to connect with others.

# Marketing

In addition to our target audience, our team aims to market Connectedsy towards mental health professionals. The goal is to encourage such professionals to join our chat rooms and provide advice to users. This would be a great opportunity for mental health professionals to provide valuable support and advice on a charitable basis.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* As a user, I would like a platform where I can meet and chat to people virtually.
* As a user, I would like to be able to sign into the platform and select specific hobbies and interests so that I can join groups with people who have similar hobbies and interests.
* As a user, I would find it helpful if the chatroom could provide the group with topic relevant ice breaker questions, to help start a conversation.

#### Returning/Frequent Visitor Goals

* As a regular user, I would like to have my hobbies and interests saved to a profile after I sign up, so that when I am returning to the platform I can just sign in and jump straight into my preferred chatroom.
* As a user, I would like a section of the platform that provides information on mental health issues and online resources I can use if I need them.

## Design

### Colour Scheme


![Site Colour Palette](documentation/design/collor%20pallet.JPG)

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

Fonts used: Montserrat, Raleway.

The Montserrat family is used in the header text and  with Raleway being used in the individual section content. Sans-serif is set as the fallback font in every case in case the other fonts cannot be imported correctly. Montserrat and Raleway are used as they are clean, sleek and easy to read.

### Imagery

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop with [Balsamiq]()

[Desktop](/documentation/wireframes/desktop.pdf) |
[Tablet](/documentation/wireframes/tab.pdf) |
[Mobile](/documentation/wireframes/mobile.pdf) |

### Features

The website is comprised of:

1.


* Future Implementations.

  * In a future update of Connectedsy, we will implement special profiles on the platform for mental health professionals. The aim here would be for mental health professionals to join chat rooms based on their particular areas of expertise and provide advice to users where appropriate and on a pro-bono basis.

  * In a future update of Connectedsy, we will include a blog page that provides users with information on mental health issues, along with online resources they can use.

  * There is a known bug on the platform which allows users to send empty chat messages. Our team is aiming to fix this in a future update of Connectedsy. More information can be found in the Known Bugs section of the testing.md file.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

### Using Heroku
- Development Enviroment
  1.  Create env.py : It needs to contain these 3 variables.
    - [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
    - Secret key is the password of your choice.
    - [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/) postgreSQL.
    ![env file](/documentation/deployment/env.jpg)
  2. Create requirements.txt file that includes all dependencies needed for the project.
    
    - You can do this by executing the following command in the terminal:
      ```
      pip freeze > requirements.txt
      ```
    
    - Or using the package pipreqs.
      ```
      pipreqs requirements.txt
      ```

  3. Create Procfile containing the commands to run the app.

    - In our case, we are using the following commands:
      ```
      web: daphne group_chatting.asgi:application --port $PORT --bind 0.0.0.0 -v2
      worker: python manage.py runworker -v2 channel_layer
      ```

    - First command shows what server to use, what application to run and what port to use.
    - Second command starts the worker for the channel layer.

  4. Commit and push deployment changes to Github.
  5. Create an account and login to Heroku
    - Create a new app, with an appropriate app name and choose a region.
    ![Create App](/documentation/deployment/heroku-create-app.jpg)
    - In Resources add Heroku Postgres and Heroku Redis.
    ![Resources](/documentation/deployment/heroku-resources.jpg)
    - Within your newly created app go to settings go to Config Vars use the DATABASE_URL Value and add it to your env.py file also you need to connect it via settings.py.
    ![Config Vars](/documentation/deployment/heroku-configvars.jpg)
    - Create a SECRET_KEY Key and the Value as the desired key.
    - Download and install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
    - And pass following commands in your github terminal:
      - $ heroku login -i
      - Then enter your login credentials
      - $ git add .
      - $ git commit -am "make it better"
      - $ git push heroku main
