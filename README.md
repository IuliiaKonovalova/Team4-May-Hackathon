Hackathon Mental health list. 

 

Anxiety: 

Anxiety is a feeling of worry or unease. Everyone feels anxious at some point, though these feelings are usually short-lived and don't affect day-to-day life. Anxiety becomes a problem when it starts to affect your health and your enjoyment of life. 
 
Social Anxiety 

Social anxiety is a frustrating mental health problem for anyone who would like to or needs to interact with people socially. Symptoms include: 

Fears – of being judged, embarrassed, or humiliated, of strangers, that others will notice you look anxious, of physical symptoms others might notice 

Behaviors – avoiding speaking to others or being the center of attention, analyzing your social performance after the fact 

Physical – blushing, trembling, sweating, fast heartbeat, nausea, lack of breath, dizziness, blank mind, muscle tension 

Managing anxiety involves learning how to recognize feelings and finding ways to cope with them. You may find you can do this on your own or you may want to look for professional help. 

Ideas that may help include: 

- Thinking about your concerns 
- Learn to live in the now 
- Be kind to yourself 
- Stay active 
- Stay social 

 

 

Bipolar Disorder: 

Several mental disorders come under the umbrella of bipolar disorder. If you have one of these mental health conditions, you will have depressive episodes with any of the depression signs. You will also have manic or hypomanic symptoms. Manic symptoms include: 

Emotions – upbeat, wired, euphoric 

Thoughts – racing thoughts, distractibility, excessive self-confidence, lack of judgment, extreme risk-taking 

Physical – increased energy or agitation, needing less sleep or food. 

 

Self-help strategies for bipolar disorder 

Monitor your mood. 

Develop a schedule/routine to keep your mood as stable as possible. 

Take your time in making decisions. 

Build a good support network/join support groups. 

 

 

Depression: 

 

Depression is a low mood that can last for weeks, months or could be persistent and affect your daily life. 

Symptoms of depression include feeling unhappy or hopeless, low self-esteem and finding no pleasure in things you usually enjoy. 

They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety. 

There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. 

The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. 

 

Treatment for depression usually involves a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicines. 

Self-care TX. 

Treatment for depression usually involves a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicines. 

Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise, cutting down on alcohol, giving up smoking and eating healthily. 

Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. 

 

 

 

 

Eating Disorders:  

An eating disorder is when a person has an unhealthy relationship with food, which can take over their life and make them ill. It commonly starts in young people aged 13 to 17 years old. An eating disorder diagnosis is based on eating patterns, which include tests on weight, blood factors, and BMI. 

Someone with an eating disorder may find their behaviour towards eating changes. For example, they may worry a lot about their weight and shape, make sudden major changes to their diet, avoid social situations that involve food and/or make themselves vomit after meals. They may experience fainting or feel cold or dizzy, which are all signs of starvation. 

There are different types of eating disorders, which are explained below: 

Anorexia Nervosa 
By not eating enough food or exercising too much, people with this condition keep their weight down. This could cause them to starve their body of essential nutrients, which can make them very ill. 

Bulimia Nervosa 
By bingeing (going through periods of eating a lot of food quickly) and then getting rid of the calories in unhealthy ways, people with this condition can make themselves sick, use laxatives, exercise too much, or take medication or use diet supplements. 

Binge-eating disorder: 
This is where some people regularly eat large portions of food all at once until they feel uncomfortably full, and then often feel guilty or upset. 

OSFED: 
This refers to ‘other specified feeding or eating disorder’ and means they don’t have all the typical symptoms of one of the types above. 

 

Psychological therapy 
Psychological interventions offer opportunities to replace negative eating behaviours with positive ones, thus resulting in regular eating habits. Such consequences mean individuals can also benefit from positive mood alterations that result from positive eating habits. 

Psychological therapy can normalize a person’s eating patterns and help them to achieve a healthy weight, exchange unhealthy habits for healthy ones, develop skills to monitor their eating and their moods, and explore healthy ways to cope with stressful situations. 
Examples of different types of therapy include: 

CBT - Cognitive behavioural therapy 
This psychotherapy focuses on behaviours, thoughts, and feelings that relate to their eating disorder. This can help explore healthy behaviours as well as improving a person’s mood. 

FBT - Family-based therapy 
Having family around the process can help those with an eating disorder get back to healthy eating patterns. 

GCBT - Group cognitive behavioural therapy 
This therapy requires meeting those who are experiencing an eating disorder and going through therapy together with a psychologist. 

Nutrition Education 
Nutritional education teaches how nutrition affects the body and explores meal plans, establishes regular eating patterns and takes steps to avoid dieting or bingeing. 

 

Chronic loneliness: 

 

It means that you feel like you are entirely alone and have no one to support you; sometimes it is more a perception than a reality. You could be constantly surrounded by people and still feel like you are lonely. 

Inability to connect with others 

No close friends 

Feelings of isolation 

Feelings of self-doubt and low self-worth 

Exhaustion and burnout 

 

Negative Mental Impressions 

First, there are detrimental impressions left on the brain. The human brain processes loneliness in the same manner as physical pain. In layman's terms, although human beings may be able to consciously tell the difference between physical distress and the emotional wounds of chronic loneliness, the brain cannot make the distinction. 

Susceptibility To: 

- Alzheimer's Disease/Dementia 
- Heart Disease 
- Insomnia And Other Sleep Disorders 

 

 

 

 

Post-traumatic stress disorder: 

 

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a condition that some people develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic life-threatening event or serious injury. 
Traumatic events can make us feel that our lives are unpredictable, that we are out of control, find it difficult to feel safe and trust other people, ourselves and our judgements. Our experiences often feel unfair, unjust, inhumane and cruel and can make us question our assumptions about the world and others. We can lose faith and become disconnected from others. 

 
PTSD typically causes four different groups of symptoms:  

reliving the traumatic event perhaps in the form of flashback, nightmares or intrusive memories (also called re-experiencing or intrusion); 

avoiding situations that are reminders of the event; 

negative changes in beliefs and feelings; 

and feeling hypervigilant and fearful to people and the world around you (also called hyperarousal). 

 

 

Postpartum depression: 

 

Postnatal depression is a type of depression that parents can have after having a baby. 

Postnatal depression can start any time in the first year after giving birth. 

Signs that you or someone you know might be depressed include: 

a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood 

lack of enjoyment and loss of interest in the wider world 

lack of energy and feeling tired all the time 

trouble sleeping at night and feeling sleepy during the day 

difficulty bonding with your baby 

withdrawing from contact with other people 

problems concentrating and making decisions 

frightening thoughts – for example, about hurting your baby 

Many women do not realize they have postnatal depression, because it can develop gradually.
