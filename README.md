# Most common Mental Health issues that people face on a day to day basis, in no particular order.

# Anxiety: 

 Anxiety is a feeling of worry or unease. Everyone feels anxious at some point, though these feelings are usually short-lived and don't affect day-to-day life. Anxiety becomes a problem when it starts to affect your health and your enjoyment of life. 
 
  Within this section we've selected the more common form of anxiety, Social Anxiety:

Social anxiety is a frustrating mental health problem for anyone who would like to or needs to interact with people socially. 

## Symptoms include: 

+ Fears – of being judged, embarrassed, or humiliated, that others will notice you look anxious.

+ Behaviors – avoiding speaking to others or being the center of attention, analyzing your social performance after the fact 

+ Physical – blushing, trembling, sweating, fast heartbeat, nausea, lack of breath, dizziness, blank mind, muscle tension. 

Managing anxiety involves learning how to recognize feelings and finding ways to cope with them. You may find you can do this on your own or you may want to look for professional help. 

**Ideas that may help include:**

- Thinking about what concerns you 
- Learn to live in the now 
- Be kind to yourself 
- Stay active 
- Stay social 

<br>

# 2 - Bipolar Disorder: 

Several mental disorders come under the umbrella of bipolar disorder. If you have one of these mental health conditions, you will have depressive episodes with any of the depression signs. You will also have manic or hypomanic symptoms. 

### Manic symptoms include: 

+ Emotions – upbeat, wired, euphoric.

+ Thoughts – racing thoughts, distractibility, excessive self-confidence, lack of judgment, extreme risk-taking.

+ Physical – increased energy or agitation, needing less sleep or food. 

 
### Self-help strategies for bipolar disorder 

+ Monitor your mood. 
+ Develop a schedule/routine to keep your mood as stable as possible. 
+ Take your time in making decisions. 
+ Build/join a good support group.

<br>

# 3 - Depression:  

Depression is a low mood that can last for weeks, months or could be persistent and affect your daily life. 
Symptoms may range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful.

There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. 

The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. 

### Self-care treatment.

Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise, cutting down on alcohol, giving up smoking and eating healthily. 

Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive.

<br>

# 4 - Eating Disorders:  

This is when a person has an unhealthy relationship with food, which can take over their life and make them ill. It commonly starts in young people aged 13 to 17 years old. A diagnosis is based on eating patterns, which include tests on weight, blood factors, and BMI.

Someone with an eating disorder may find their behaviour towards eating ever-changing. For example, they may worry a lot about their weight and shape, make sudden major changes to their diet, avoid social situations that involve food and/or make themselves vomit after meals. They may experience fainting or feel cold or dizzy, which are all signs of starvation. 

There are different types of eating disorders, which are explained below: 

+ Anorexia Nervosa 
By not eating enough food or exercising too much, people with this condition keep their weight down. This could cause them to starve their body of essential nutrients, which can make them very ill. 

+ Bulimia Nervosa 
People with this condition binge-eat and then try to rid of the calories in unhealthy ways, such as making themselves sick, use laxatives, exercise too much, or take medication and/or use diet supplements in excess.

+ Binge-eating disorder: 
This is where some people regularly eat large portions of food all at once until they feel uncomfortably full, and then often feel guilty or upset. 

+ OSFED: 
This refers to ‘other specified feeding or eating disorder’ and means they don’t have all the typical symptoms of one of the types above. 

### **Psychological therapy**

Psychological interventions offer opportunities to replace negative eating behaviours with positive ones, thus resulting in regular and positive eating habits.
It can normalize a person’s eating patterns and help them to achieve a healthy weight, exchange unhealthy habits for healthy ones, develop skills to monitor their eating and their moods, and explore healthy ways to cope with stressful situations. 

### Examples of different types of therapy include: 

+ CBT - Cognitive behavioural therapy 
This psychotherapy focuses on behaviours, thoughts, and feelings that relate to their eating disorder. This can help explore healthy behaviours as well as improving a person’s mood. 

+ FBT - Family-based therapy 
Having family around the process can help those with an eating disorder get back to healthy eating patterns. 

+ GCBT - Group cognitive behavioural therapy 
This therapy requires meeting those who are experiencing an eating disorder and going through therapy together with a psychologist. 

+ Nutrition Education 
Nutritional education teaches how nutrition affects the body, explores meal plans, establishes regular eating patterns and takes steps to avoid dieting or binge-eating.

# 5 - Chronic loneliness: 

It means that you feel like you are entirely alone and have no one to support you; sometimes this is more a perception than a reality. You could be constantly surrounded by people and still feel like you are alone. 

### Some of the symptoms you may experience:

- Inability to connect with others 
- No close friends 
- Feelings of isolation 
- Feelings of self-doubt and low self-worth 
- Exhaustion and burnout 

**Negative Mental Impressions**

First, there are detrimental impressions left on the brain. The human brain processes loneliness in the same manner as physical pain. In layman's terms, although human beings may be able to consciously tell the difference between physical and emotuionemotional distress, the brain cannot make the distinction. 

### People suffering with this condition may be susceptible to: 

- Alzheimer's Disease/Dementia 
- Heart Disease 
- Insomnia And Other Sleep Disorders 

<br>

# 6 - (PTSD) Post-traumatic Stress Disorder: 

PTSD is a condition that some people may develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic life-threatening event or serious injury. 

Traumatic events can make us feel that our lives are unpredictable, that we are out of control and therefore find it difficult to feel safe and trust other people, ourselves and our judgements.
 
### PTSD typically causes four different groups of symptoms:  

- Reliving the traumatic event perhaps in the form of flashback, nightmares or intrusive memories (also called re-experiencing or intrusion). 
- Avoiding situations that are reminders of the event.
- Negative changes in beliefs and feelings.
- And feeling hypervigilant and fearful to people and the world around you (also called hyperarousal).

<br>

# 7 - Postpartum depression: 

Postnatal depression is a type of depression that parents can have after having a baby and it can start any time in the first year after giving birth. 

### Symptoms that may display are:

- A persistent feeling of sadness and low mood.
- Lack of enjoyment and loss of interest in the wider world.
- Lack of energy and feeling tired all the time.
- Trouble sleeping at night and feeling sleepy during the day.
- Difficulty bonding with your baby.
- Withdrawing from contact with other people.
- Problems concentrating and making decisions.
- Frightening thoughts – for example, about hurting your baby.

Many women do not realize they have postnatal depression, because it can develop gradually.
Postnatal depression can be lonely, distressing and frightening, but support and effective treatments are available.

# Short description for each chat room.

- 1st Chat room / Social Anxiety:

If you are the type of person that avoids speaking to others and over analyze your social performance, feel free to open up with the people in this chat and it'll surprise you how many individuals go through similar experiences.

- 2nd Chat room / Bipolar:

You feel like nobody can meet you at your highest and lowest points because they don't understand. Sharing each eachother's experiences will give you a different perspective and hopefully a new way to deal with the matter in question. 

- 3rd Chat room / Depression:

We've all heard the clichés of go excercise, read a self-help book, just get out and find to distract yourself.. Sometimes all you need is someone to listen to what you have to say, empathy. Join us, you are not alone.

- 4th Chat room / Gender Dysphoria (gender identity):

Just like that lasting desire to live a life that "matches" your identity, join us for a chance to match & exchange ideas and experiences with like-minded individuals with zero judgement.

- 5th Chat room / Eating Disorders:

It's never easy to embark on a self-improving journey, taking that leap can be scary because it's not what we're used to. Ask questions, talk about it, give your opinion and don't be afraid to ask for advice.

- 6th Chat room / PTSD:

Sometimes talking to the people we know can add an extra layer of pressure on top of what you're already going through. Talk to a stranger, see what they have to say and you may find something useful in other people's stories.

- 7th Chat room / Post-partum Depression:

Feelings of detachment from your partner and your baby can be an incredibly daunting experience which in turn leads to loneliness. Allow yourself to be part of a community again, there's strength in numbers.
